# Firebird-Express-API
Node JS API using Express and Firebird database 

Project created to start my studies with Node JS.
In it, I use the Express framework, along with some other resources with the purpose of creating an API for communication with a Firebird database.


How to run:

npm install --save express

npm install --save node-firebird
